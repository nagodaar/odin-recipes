<p>Someone with more patience and creativity than me would actually write a description here. This is just an excercise.</p>
<p>Insert another quote/unquote paragraph of a description of a mouthwatering Buffalo Chicken Dip, courtest of Western New York.</p>

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 lbs of raw chicken, cut doesn't matter as long as it shreds!</li>
    <li>2x 8oz blocks of cream cheese</li>
    <li>A fuck ton of hot sauce (Frank's is tradition!)</li>
    <li>Seasonings to taste, add some depth not just spice!</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Cut the chicken into larger chunks.</li>
    <li>Brown it all the way around the outside</li>
    <li>Dump in almost all the hot sauce, all the cream cheese, and a little butter</li>
    <li>Pressure cook that mf on high for about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>I'm sure there was more, but really who cares? It's dip ya moron just make it.</li>
    <li>Be better than me, top it with chives and don't throw half of it our 3.5 weeks later.</li>
</ol>
